LESS THAN THAT, maybe 3.10
- 3.10 is not it, try 3.20
- 3.15
- this is it, it rolls on in

hole 2
3 on the second line, a little to the left of that line
- this is it

hole 3
3.25 first line on the left
- this is it

hole 4
3.5 is not it, neither is 3.25, try 3.75

- this is it

hole 5
+3.75, middle of the box on the second to the left
- this is it

hole 6
3.25 on the right box line
-little bit more than 3.25
-try 3.5
- this is it

hole 7
3.25 is not enough, maybe 3.5, on the first line from the left edge
- 3.5 for sure
- try a little of the left of that line
- nope, try to the right
- gotta be right on the edge
- maybe it's a little more to the right of the edge
- yup, little more to the right, maybe the middle

hole 8
just under 4 on the right side (between column)
- this is it, 3.9

HOle 9
just under 3 is not enough, in the middle
- 3.25 is too much, maybe 3
-just under 3, maybe 2.95
- too close to count, maybe 2.9?
- Just over 3.0, maybe 3.05
- try 3.01
- probably just 3
- try 2.95
- this is it, have to aim just at the hole for a 'nothing but net'

hole 10
3.33, middle of the full box from the left
- this is it
- correction, maybe it's 3.25
- 3.20, this is it

hole 11
2.9 is too much
try 3.25

- 2.5
- try 2.55

- this is it

hole 12
full blast, middle of the block to the right from the middle, second block from the right
- this is it, arrows pointing down

hole 13
2.5 is not enough, maybe 2.75?
- yup, 2.75
- this is it

hole 14
unknown
- bounce of left wall full blast to skip all that shit, unknown where
- 3.75 on the left block going up
- no idea, fuck this hole
  - try bouncing it off the left and then skip all that shit
- the block wit hthe arrows pointing up, to the middle with full blast gets you to the hole
- this is the block, adjust slightly left or right and smidgen less?
- try to the left instead, right did not work
- try going out of bounds, to go in bounds
- good strategy... no idea where though

hole 15
3.5 is too much, it's the first line from the left
try 2.75
- try 2.9
 - nope, bounced right out... maybe 3?
 -, nope, try 3.25
 - try 3 again
 - nope, try 3.10
 - nope, try 2.95
 - nope, try 3.05
 - nope, try 2.80

hole 16
middle block, full blast (arrows pointing down)
slightly to the right of it
- do this, i didn't and messed up
- this is it

hole 17
not sure, look to the right, maybe the first line on the right
- try going straight
- can't get this one to work
- fuck this one
- bounce left instead to bounce right then bounce left
- got close but no cigar, maybe something different
- that might be it, left two lines, more to the right, full blast
- forget this strategy... come up with a new one
- FOUND IT, it's running the ball off the bridge and hitting the triangle shaped pillar support at full blast - Left Side right where the wall ends and the bridge opens up
- very close to the right edge of the left bridge opening
- right strategy, not sure where

hole 18
full blast on the right line from the edge
- this is it
